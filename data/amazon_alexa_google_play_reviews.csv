Too condescending. You ask for the temperature and you get a full weather report. Lots of display widgets that cannot be turned off. I just want a very simple voice control.

"I'm unsure what has changed but Alexa no longer works as well as it used to. i have 1 device that does not respond back despite that feature being turned on. Alexa also no longer searches for and finds new devices (i e. light bulbs, digital door locks, thermostat, etc). I'm thinking of deleting everything and starting from scratch.

"3 stars because the app is VERY buggy, but when it works, it's great and full of helpful features and cool stuff you can use and set up with your Alexa enabled devices. Tbh, it's been behaving for me today, but if it wasn't, I'd probably only give it 2 stars because it really can be extremely irritating when it's constantly freezing up and certain functions and features aren't working and/or saving properly.

Alexa never works and can't get anything right. the device constantly lowers its volume and then it can't understand half of what you're saying so it tells you some off the wall stuff it's the biggest pain I've ever seen.,1,0,2024-08-23 00:29:20,

Can no longer edit routine names since the past two updates. The keyboard comes up and disappears on the android app. There is no other way to make routines which is terrible when you have long names used and the screen cuts off text displayed. There is no PC web interface to do this which is extremely poor decision to not have a backup interface in case there are issues with mobile devices or bugs like this. Apparently there is a web interface that is slowly having functionality removed. üò°,2,22,2024-08-22 23:23:13,

"Does it work? Yeah. Does it work RELIABLY? Naw. Does it work well enough that I miss it when it's disabled? Yeah. The most reliable aspect is the time-based routine, but even then, some home automation tasks will happen *close* to when they should, but not at the precise designated time. The signature feature, voice control of home automation, is only a 85-90% thing, and that's due to the still-problematic voice recognition.",3,39,2024-08-22 18:23:29,
