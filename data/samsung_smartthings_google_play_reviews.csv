"Can't set the clock w/o wifi. OMG I hate this confusing mess so much. I have an oven, yet you can't simply tap on it in the app to go to the device. The oven preheats to 400F before you can even find your way through this stupid maze of an app. SlowThings app makes baking such a complicated chore to just simply preheat. What could've been a couple simple buttons they've turned into multiple, slow responding screens to wade through. No ""smarts"" here to save the same damn settings used every day.",1,40,2024-10-08 15:13:09,"Hi Mark, we apologize for the inconvenience caused.

9/25/24 Still bad OS. Often when streaming the TV will freeze. (None of my Roku TVs have an issue). Also Give an option to have the TV go into super energy saving mode based on a schedule. IE at 2Am I dont need my TV displaying a photo. 1/24/24 I'm shocked that it's so hard to even have the basic feature of being able to set the art modes photo working. ( For the Frame tv) I mean hard not in the sense of the UI but that the app doesn't actually set the TV's photo.,1,39,2024-09-26 04:04:55,"Hi Josh, we apologize for any issue you might be having!

"I love my Samsung washing machine! App could have little better UI for workflows. Too many taps to get to start my laundry cycle. Also, feature request: - develop other/additional washing programs for my Samsung washer. The only Eco wash is too hot (40'-60'). I could use the Cold wash, but I'd assume you can offer a much wider library of smart cycles for my highly capable Samsung WW9T.",4,1,2024-09-23 19:40:04,

"The most annoying, inconvenient time wasting app that has ever been forced on me by any android device I've ever had. Was bad enough to the point I considered returning my S-24. You're basically bullied into using the apps because android devices doesn't support a device management center anymore, and when you use this is forces your location and wifi. This app burns battery life like you wouldn't believe it.

"Not that I expect better from Samsung since they've basically been passing off $20 disposable phones as top-tier tech for the last few years, but this ""smart things"" app is about as good at recognizing, locating, and interfacing between Samsung devices as my cat. I don't have a cat. It often detects nothing, and troubleshooting is never an option. Plus, after a year of dealing with their customer ""support,"" for a variety of other problems, I'm 100% avoiding the support link they gave me.

"May be a marvellous app if you're the only person using any of the appliances. If two adults want to access the same, say, washing machine one of them will have to be subservient to the other. Despite living in the same home you'll need to set up separate locations for each person and change between the two searching for the one that has the device registered to it.",1,7,2024-09-13 21:29:24,
