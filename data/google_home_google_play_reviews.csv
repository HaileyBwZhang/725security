We had to switch to Google home for our new camera we added. We used the original nest home app until yesterday and I just don't like Google home.

I purchased my nest years ago and have always had 5 days of free recording all of the sudden it stopped. I did not agree to this why did this happen? Did you violate my rights?

"Edit: tried suppport and they hung up on me Used to work ok but seems to get worse over time. I no longer get any notifications, e.g. from cameras m, even though I've checked all the troubleshooting steps. Many functions for devices have only limited options within the app, making this one less important. Automation routines are nice but take a long time to set up that could have a better UI.

It's getting worse. I love it but after this year it's gotten so bad I can't turn on or off my lights and my 2 of my nests stopped working altogether. I'm really po about it since I use them heavy. This becomes a super inconvenience when the lights are unreachable for me at night. I very much annoyed to the point that I'm going to say screw it I go back to the old ways. And unplug them all. This sucks cuz I really like not having to walk though my house to turn off lights and other stuff.,3,14,2024-08-22 03:48:15,
